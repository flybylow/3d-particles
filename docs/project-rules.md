# Project Rules

## Rule #1: Documentation Location

**All documentation files must be placed in the `/docs` folder, never in the root.**

This is the first and most important rule of this project. Whenever we learn something new or need to document features, implementation details, or decisions:

1. Create a new document in the `/docs` folder
2. Use Markdown format (`.md`)
3. Give it a descriptive name
4. Update the docs/README.md index if needed

**Never put documentation files in the root directory. Always move them to the `/docs` folder.**

This keeps the project organized and makes it easy to find all documentation in one place.

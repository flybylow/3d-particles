# Public Assets

This folder contains public assets and reference documentation for the 3D Particles Hero Animation project.

## Contents

### 📄 hero-animation-handoff.md
Complete handoff document from Ward and Emma's planning session detailing the three-act narrative structure:
- **Act 1: CHAOS** - "Your supply chain is noise"
- **Act 2: CLARITY** - "One scan"
- **Act 3: REVELATION** - "Know your product"

Includes design decisions, technical scope, brand alignment, and product selection rationale (chocolate bar).

### 📸 screenshots/
Visual documentation of the animation in all three phases:

- **hero-animation-chaos.png** - Act 1: Scattered particle storm
- **hero-animation-phase.png** - Act 2: Barcode formation  
- **hero-animation-test.png** - Act 3: Chocolate bar reveal

These screenshots verify the implementation matches the handoff specifications.

### 📦 models/
Reserved for future 3D models if needed. Currently, the animation uses procedurally generated geometry (see `components/ChocolateBarGeometry.tsx`) instead of external model files for better performance and flexibility.
